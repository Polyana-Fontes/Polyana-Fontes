# Welcome to my profile ≽^•༚• ྀི≼
I'm a senior Java and Kotlin developer who loves gaming, I'm <img alt="Autistic Ribbon" aria-hidden="true" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Autism.svg/250px-Autism.svg.png" height="14"/> autistic and development has always been **my hyperfocus** since I had my first contact with HTML by accident at my 4th grade school's computer _(yes, I had 9 years old)_

I love contributing to open-source projects, specially the ones that helps Minecraft community somehow.
